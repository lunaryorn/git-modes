;;; Commentary:

;; Use the Emacsclient as $EDITOR of child processes, making sure
;; they know how to call home.  For remote processes a substitute is
;; provided, which communicates with Emacs on stdout instead of using
;; a socket as the Emacsclient does.

;; Additionally `with-editor-mode' provides some utilities that make
;; it nicer to specialize edit sessions.
